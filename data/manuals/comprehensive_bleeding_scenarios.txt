QUICK REFERENCE DECISION TREE

BLEEDING IDENTIFIED
↓
Life-threatening? (>Class 2 shock, spurting blood, large vessels)
├─ YES → Direct pressure + Elevation + Call EMS immediately
│         ↓
│         Controlled in 2 minutes?
│         ├─ NO → Pressure point + Consider tourniquet
│         └─ YES → Monitor and transport
│
└─ NO → Direct pressure + Elevation
         ↓
         Controlled in 10 minutes?
         ├─ NO → Reassess for missed injury + EMS
