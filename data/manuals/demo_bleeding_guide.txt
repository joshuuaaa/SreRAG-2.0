WHO Emergency Care Guidelines: Severe Bleeding

OVERVIEW
Severe bleeding (hemorrhage) is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate action. Blood loss of more than 20% can lead to shock and death.

DIRECT PRESSURE TECHNIQUE
The most effective method to control bleeding is direct pressure:
1. Use a clean cloth or gauze pad
2. Apply firm, continuous pressure directly on the wound
3. Maintain pressure for at least 10 minutes without checking
4. If blood soaks through, add more material on top - do NOT remove the first layer

ELEVATION
Elevate the injured area above the heart level if possible. This reduces blood flow to the area and helps control bleeding. Only do this if:
- No broken bones are suspected
- You can maintain pressure while elevating

EMBEDDED OBJECTS
NEVER remove embedded objects (glass, metal, wood) from a wound:
- Removing them can cause massive bleeding
- The object may be plugging a severed blood vessel
- Apply pressure around the object, not directly on it
- Secure it in place with bulky dressings

SHOCK PREVENTION
Monitor for signs of shock:
- Pale, cold, clammy skin
- Rapid, weak pulse
- Rapid breathing
- Confusion or loss of consciousness

If shock develops:
- Lay the person flat
- Elevate legs 12 inches (if no spinal injury suspected)
- Keep warm with blankets
- Do NOT give food or water

WHEN TO USE A TOURNIQUET
Tourniquets are a LAST RESORT for limb bleeding when direct pressure fails:
- Only use if trained
- Apply 2-3 inches above the wound (not on a joint)
- Tighten until bleeding stops
- Note the time applied
- Do NOT loosen once applied

CALL FOR HELP
Always call emergency services immediately for severe bleeding. Time is critical.
